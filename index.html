            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Gibran Gomez is a cybersecurity researcher, currently working at IMDEA Software Institute,
                specializing in <strong>applying data science</strong> and <strong>threat intelligence</strong>
                to contribute to solve <strong>blockchain-based attribution challenges</strong>.
                His passion for understanding the exploitation of emerging technologies
                has driven him to master a range of penetration testing security tools and programming languages.
                With a robust understanding of operating systems, web platforms, and network protocols,
                his expertise enables him to monitor, analyze, and extract <strong>key insights</strong>
                from suspicious activity in the crypto ecosystem from a <strong>comprehensive cybersecurity perspective</strong>.
                In his research, he has developed novel techniques to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#wyb">Trace cryptocurrency transactions</a> (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin)
                    and <strong>characterize addresses</strong> associated with malicious actors
                    (e.g., ransomware, clippers, scams).
                    Using backward Bitcoin transaction tracing,
                    his team uncovered previously unknown economic connections between cybercriminals and third-party services
                    (e.g., cryptocurrency exchanges);
                    blockchain addresses used by malware for C&C server communication;
                    and the <a href="#btcest">complete set of BTC addresses DeadBolt used to receive ransom payments</a>.
                    His work has also <strong>enhanced the accuracy of revenue estimates</strong> in Bitcoin,
                    allowing better analyses of cybercriminal groups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Collect <a href="#goodfatr">actionable threat intelligence</a> from public sources
                    (e.g., blogs, social networks) using open protocols (e.g., RSS, platform APIs),
                    <strong>improving cryptocurrency attribution data</strong> using verified sources
                    (e.g., threat reports from major cybersecurity vendors),
                    and contributing to more effective cybercrime investigations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analyze the <a href="#arc">quality of reports</a> in cryptocurrency-abuse reporting services
                    at scale (e.g., BitcoinAbuse, ScamTracker), using large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Llama)
                    and other NLP models (e.g., BERT) to <strong>identify and mitigate data pollution</strong>,
                    thereby improving data reliability and cybercrime analyses.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                During his research, he understood the <strong>impact and extent of cryptocurrency abuse on victims</strong>,
                including the ways attackers exploit different services to perpetuate further abuse
                (e.g., funds-recovery scams, phishing).
                This insight showed him the urgent need for novel techniques to combat these emerging threats.

                            to analyze and characterize malware families that abuse the <strong>TLS protocol</strong> to encrypt their network traffic.

                            to strengthen digital security practices among human rights defenders and journalists
                            through the progressive adoption of libre software solutions.
                            The project delivered workshops and online training programs,

                            to 17 NGOs with critical privacy concerns across Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.
                            The online collaborative program lasted two years.

                        <strong>Software Developer and Consultant – HumanSys (Sistemas Humanos S.A. de C.V.)</strong>
                        <p>
                                As a Software Developer, Gibran contributed to a wide range of projects,
                            taking on roles from junior to senior levels across both back-end and front-end development.
                            The development environment was Agile and followed methodologies like Scrum and Scrumban.
                            During this period, he primarily worked with Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE) technologies
                            (such as GlassFish, Hibernate, Spring Framework, and ICEfaces)
                            to develop large-scale, enterprise-grade applications
                            and with SQL-based database management systems,
                            including Oracle Database 11g, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.
                            He also contributed to projects using Python, Groovy, JavaScript, and Bash
                            for scripting, automation, and web development tasks,
                            using Apache Subversion and Git for source code management.
